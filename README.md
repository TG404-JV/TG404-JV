Hi! Iâ€™m Tejas Kale, a passionate Android Developer with a knack for building user-friendly and innovative apps. Based in Khupta, Maharashtra, Iâ€™m currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering.

From developing the [DoctorCubes app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tvm.doctorcube) to creating an AI-powered quiz app, I love turning ideas into impactful solutions. When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me exploring new tech trends, contributing to open-source projects, or pondering the mysteries of the universe.
